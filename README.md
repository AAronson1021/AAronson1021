-Hello My name is Alexander Aronson, I'm a Mathematical Science student at Maryville University.
-As a math major, I'm required to take Data Science as my minor, as a result I yearn to learn more about the versitility of the different languages, and 
just how much is possible with Excel, R and Python. Most of my post will be basic projects that were given as homework, I'm looking to have them improved, added to, or all around just learn more about the power of each language/program! My personal hobby is centered around cars. Whether it's racing them, attending car shows, modifying ecu maps or binge watching youtube reviews, I'm a big car enthusiast!  Most of the reason I began gaining interest in programming was due to my love for cars. I taught myself how to alter the calibrations for optimum performance, of course utilizing already created software. Nonetheless, I wold love to learn how to convert the binary files and completely develop a calibration software for others from scratch. 

-Hope someone gets use from my repository maybe for their class project, or just a simple refresher. All the best!
